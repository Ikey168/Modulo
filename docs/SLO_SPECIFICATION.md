# üéØ Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for Modulo

This document defines the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the Modulo platform, providing clear targets for reliability, performance, and availability.

## üìä SLO Overview

Service Level Objectives define the target level of service that users can expect from Modulo. These SLOs are backed by Service Level Indicators (SLIs) measured through Prometheus metrics and enforced through multi-window burn-rate alerting.

## üéØ Defined SLOs

### 1. üìñ **Read Performance SLO**

**Objective**: 95% of read operations complete within 200ms (P95 latency)

- **SLI**: P95 latency of HTTP GET requests to API endpoints
- **Target**: 200ms
- **Measurement Window**: 30 days
- **Error Budget**: 5% (36 hours of degraded performance per month)

**PromQL SLI Query**:
```promql
# Read P95 Latency SLI
histogram_quantile(0.95, 
  sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_bucket{
    application="modulo-backend",
    method="GET",
    status!~"[45].*"
  }[5m])) by (le)
) * 1000 < 200
```

**Business Impact**: Affects user experience for note retrieval, search, and dashboard loading.

### 2. ‚úèÔ∏è **Write Performance SLO**

**Objective**: 95% of write operations complete within 500ms (P95 latency)

- **SLI**: P95 latency of HTTP POST/PUT/DELETE requests to API endpoints
- **Target**: 500ms
- **Measurement Window**: 30 days
- **Error Budget**: 5% (36 hours of degraded performance per month)

**PromQL SLI Query**:
```promql
# Write P95 Latency SLI
histogram_quantile(0.95, 
  sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_bucket{
    application="modulo-backend",
    method=~"POST|PUT|DELETE",
    status!~"[45].*"
  }[5m])) by (le)
) * 1000 < 500
```

**Business Impact**: Affects user experience for note creation, editing, and blockchain operations.

---

### 3. üîÑ **Sync Performance SLO**

**Objective**: 95% of sync operations complete within 1000ms (P95 latency)

- **SLI**: P95 latency of WebSocket sync operations and blockchain transactions
- **Target**: 1000ms
- **Measurement Window**: 30 days
- **Error Budget**: 5% (36 hours of degraded performance per month)

**PromQL SLI Query**:
```promql
# Sync P95 Latency SLI
histogram_quantile(0.95, 
  sum(rate(modulo_sync_operations_duration_seconds_bucket{
    status="success"
  }[5m])) by (le)
) * 1000 < 1000
```

**Business Impact**: Affects real-time collaboration and blockchain state consistency.

---

### 4. üü¢ **Availability SLO**

**Objective**: 99.9% availability (uptime) for the Modulo platform

- **SLI**: Ratio of successful HTTP requests to total HTTP requests
- **Target**: 99.9%
- **Measurement Window**: 30 days
- **Error Budget**: 0.1% (43.2 minutes of downtime per month)

**PromQL SLI Query**:
```promql
# Availability SLI
sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{
  application="modulo-backend",
  status!~"[45].*"
}[5m])) / 
sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{
  application="modulo-backend"
}[5m])) * 100 > 99.9
```

**Business Impact**: Direct impact on user access to the platform and all services.

## üî• Burn-Rate Alerting

Burn-rate alerting provides early warning when error budgets are being consumed faster than expected, allowing for proactive response before SLO violations occur.

### Multi-Window Burn-Rate Strategy

Each SLO uses a multi-window burn-rate approach with different alert severities:

1. **Critical (Page)**: Fast burn rate over short window
2. **Warning**: Moderate burn rate over medium window  
3. **Ticket**: Slow burn rate over long window

### Alert Severity Levels

#### üö® **Critical Alerts (Page Immediately)**
- **Burn Rate**: 14.4x (exhausts monthly budget in 2 hours)
- **Short Window**: 5 minutes
- **Long Window**: 1 hour
- **Action**: Immediate page to on-call engineer

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning Alerts (Investigate Soon)**
- **Burn Rate**: 6x (exhausts monthly budget in 5 hours)
- **Short Window**: 30 minutes
- **Long Window**: 6 hours
- **Action**: Notify team, investigate within 30 minutes

#### üìã **Ticket Alerts (Plan Response)**
- **Burn Rate**: 1x (exhausts monthly budget in 30 days)
- **Short Window**: 2 hours
- **Long Window**: 24 hours
- **Action**: Create ticket, investigate during business hours

## üìà SLO Dashboard

The SLO dashboard provides real-time visibility into:

- **Current SLI Performance**: Real-time metrics vs targets
- **Error Budget Status**: Remaining error budget percentage
- **Burn Rate Trends**: Historical and projected burn rates
- **Alert Status**: Active alerts and recent incidents

**Grafana Dashboard Panels**:
1. SLO Compliance Overview (gauges)
2. Error Budget Burn Down (time series)
3. SLI Performance Trends (time series)
4. Recent Alert History (table)

## üîç SLO Monitoring Strategy

### Measurement Frequency
- **SLI Collection**: Every 15 seconds
- **SLO Evaluation**: Every 1 minute
- **Error Budget Calculation**: Every 5 minutes
- **Burn Rate Assessment**: Continuous

### Data Retention
- **Raw Metrics**: 15 days
- **Aggregated SLI Data**: 90 days
