gh issue create \
    --title "🔧 Fix Smart Contract Test Configuration" \
    --body "## 🎯 Objective
Fix the failing smart contract test configuration to enable comprehensive coverage measurement.

## 📋 Current Status
- **12 failing tests** out of 123 total tests
- **Configuration errors** in hardhat.config.js preventing proper execution
- **Missing contracts** (MaliciousReentrant) causing test failures

## ✅ Tasks
- [ ] Fix hardhat.config.js syntax and configuration issues
- [ ] Implement missing MaliciousReentrant contract for security tests
- [ ] Resolve timestamp assertion failures in optimization tests
- [ ] Update test scripts to handle async operations properly
- [ ] Verify all 123 tests pass successfully
- [ ] Enable solidity-coverage plugin for accurate measurement

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All smart contract tests pass (123/123)
- [ ] Coverage reports generate without errors
- [ ] Configuration supports both testing and coverage measurement
- [ ] No syntax errors in hardhat.config.js

## 🚀 Priority: Critical
**Blocks**: All smart contract coverage improvements

Implement JaCoCo code coverage measurement for the Spring Boot backend to enable accurate coverage tracking.

## 📋 Current Status
- **No coverage measurement** currently implemented
- **Maven Surefire** tests exist but no coverage reports
- **9 test files** with 1,187 lines of test code
- **Estimated 85% coverage** but needs verification

## ✅ Tasks
- [ ] Add JaCoCo Maven plugin to backend/pom.xml
- [ ] Configure JaCoCo for unit and integration tests
- [ ] Generate HTML coverage reports
- [ ] Set up coverage thresholds and fail conditions
- [ ] Integrate coverage reports with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Document coverage measurement process

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] JaCoCo plugin configured and functional
- [ ] Coverage reports generate automatically
- [ ] HTML reports accessible for review
- [ ] Coverage metrics available for tracking
- [ ] Minimum 85% coverage threshold enforced

## 🚀 Priority: Critical
**Enables**: Backend coverage measurement and improvement
