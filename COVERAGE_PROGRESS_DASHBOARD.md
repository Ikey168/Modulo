## 🚨 Risk Dashboard

### **High Risk Items** 🔴
1. **Smart Contract Test Failures** - 12 failing tests blocking progress
   - Impact: Cannot measure accurate coverage
   - Mitigation: Assign senior blockchain developer immediately

2. **Frontend Unit Test Gap** - 30% coverage gap is largest
   - Impact: Delays overall milestone completion
   - Mitigation: Prioritize React testing framework setup

3. **Integration Test Dependencies** - No current framework
   - Impact: Cannot test end-to-end workflows
   - Mitigation: Research and select appropriate tools early

### **Medium Risk Items** 🟡
1. **Resource Allocation** - Multiple developers needed simultaneously
   - Mitigation: Stagger work, use pairing where possible

2. **Performance Impact** - New tests may slow CI/CD
   - Mitigation: Implement parallel test execution

### **Mitigated Risks** ✅
1. **Performance & Security Testing** - Already at 100%
2. **Backend Test Infrastructure** - Solid foundation exists
