- [ ] Gas optimization tests complete without reverts
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline shows green status for smart contract tests

**Definition of Done:**
- All tests pass locally and in CI
- Coverage report shows accurate percentages

        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>report</id>
            <phase>test</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>report</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] JaCoCo generates accurate coverage reports
- [ ] Coverage thresholds enforced in build (fail if below threshold)
- [ ] HTML reports generated in target/site/jacoco/
