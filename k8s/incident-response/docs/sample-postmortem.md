# Postmortem: Database Connection Pool Exhaustion - Sample

## Incident Summary

**Incident ID:** INC-20250822-001  
**Date:** 2025-08-22  
**Time:** 14:30 UTC - 15:45 UTC  
**Duration:** 1 hour 15 minutes  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** Resolved

### Impact
- **Services Affected:** API service, user authentication, payment processing
- **Users Affected:** ~8,000 users (80% of active users)
- **Revenue Impact:** Estimated $15,000 in lost transactions
- **SLA Breach:** Yes - 99.9% uptime SLA breached (99.2% for the day)

### Summary
Database connection pool exhaustion caused widespread service failures during peak usage hours. A memory leak in the newly deployed ORM connection handling prevented proper connection cleanup, leading to connection pool saturation and subsequent service unavailability.

## Timeline

### Detection
- **First Alert:** 14:30 - Prometheus alert: "High database connection count"
- **Escalation:** 14:32 - PagerDuty page sent to primary on-call
- **Acknowledgment:** 14:34 - Sarah (DevOps Lead) acknowledged and began investigation

### Investigation & Response
| Time (UTC) | Action | Person | Notes |
|------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 14:30 | Initial database connection alert fired | System | Prometheus detected 95/100 connections used |
| 14:32 | PagerDuty page sent to on-call | System | Alert escalated automatically |
| 14:34 | Alert acknowledged, investigation started | Sarah | Checked Grafana dashboards first |
| 14:36 | Status page updated to "Investigating" | Sarah | Initial user communication |
| 14:38 | Confirmed service degradation | Sarah | API error rate at 45% |
| 14:40 | Database logs reviewed | Mike | Found "too many clients" errors |
| 14:42 | Recent deployment identified as suspect | Sarah | Connection leak suspected |
| 14:45 | Incident channel created (#inc-db-connections) | Sarah | Team collaboration started |
| 14:48 | Decision made to restart API pods | Team | Quickest path to restore service |
| 14:52 | API pod restart initiated | Mike | Rolling restart to minimize downtime |
| 14:58 | Pods restarted, connections dropped to 60/100 | Mike | Partial recovery observed |
| 15:05 | Error rate decreased to 15% | Sarah | Still above normal 2% baseline |
| 15:12 | Code fix identified and prepared | Alex | Connection close() calls missing |
| 15:25 | Hotfix deployed to staging | Alex | Verified fix in staging environment |
| 15:35 | Hotfix deployed to production | Team | Careful deployment with monitoring |
| 15:42 | Error rate back to normal (2%) | Sarah | Full service restoration confirmed |
| 15:45 | Status page updated to "Operational" | Sarah | Public communication of resolution |

### Resolution
- **Fix Applied:** 15:35 - Hotfix deployed adding missing connection cleanup
- **Service Restored:** 15:42 - All metrics returned to normal ranges
- **All Clear:** 15:45 - Status page updated, incident closed

## Root Cause Analysis

### Contributing Factors
1. **Immediate Cause:** ORM configuration change in v2.3.1 deployment removed automatic connection cleanup
2. **Root Cause:** Code review missed the connection management change in the ORM upgrade
3. **Contributing Factors:** 
   - Insufficient connection pool monitoring alerts
   - No connection leak testing in CI/CD pipeline
   - Load testing didn't simulate peak connection usage patterns

### 5 Whys Analysis
1. **Why did the database become unavailable?** 
   - Connection pool was exhausted (100/100 connections used)
2. **Why was the connection pool exhausted?**
   - Database connections weren't being properly closed after use
3. **Why weren't connections being closed?**
   - ORM upgrade changed default behavior to require explicit connection cleanup
4. **Why didn't we catch this in testing?**
   - Our load tests didn't run long enough to detect connection leaks
5. **Why didn't our monitoring catch this sooner?**
   - We only had alerts for 95% connection usage, not trending analysis

---

## What Went Well

### Detection
- Prometheus monitoring successfully detected the issue before complete failure
- Automated alerting worked as designed
- On-call engineer was reached within 4 minutes

### Response
- Quick acknowledgment and investigation startup
- Effective use of incident channel for team coordination
- Good decision-making under pressure (pod restart for quick recovery)
- Clear communication on status page

### Recovery
- Rolling restart minimized downtime impact
- Staging environment allowed safe testing of fix
- Coordinated deployment prevented further issues

---

## What Went Wrong

### Detection
- Connection pool monitoring wasn't sensitive enough (95% threshold too high)
- No trending analysis to predict exhaustion
- Missing alerts for connection leak patterns

### Response
- 4-minute delay in acknowledgment (target: <2 minutes)
- Initial investigation took 14 minutes to identify root cause
- Status page update could have been more specific about impact

### Recovery
- Hotfix took 53 minutes to develop and deploy
- Should have had better automated rollback procedures
- Post-restart monitoring period could have been more thorough
