## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

### **High Priority Risks**

1. **Technical Debt in Smart Contracts** 🔴
   - **Risk:** Current failing tests indicate technical debt
   - **Impact:** Delays blockchain feature development
   - **Mitigation:** Assign senior blockchain developer immediately

2. **Frontend Testing Gap** 🔴  
   - **Risk:** 30% coverage gap is significant
   - **Impact:** UI bugs in production, poor user experience
   - **Mitigation:** Implement React testing framework first

3. **Resource Constraints** 🟡
   - **Risk:** Multiple developers needed simultaneously
   - **Impact:** Timeline delays or quality shortcuts
   - **Mitigation:** Staggered implementation, contractor support if needed

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
- **Parallel Development:** Independent tracks for different components
- **Contractor Support:** Available if internal resources are constrained
- **Scope Flexibility:** Can prioritize critical paths if timeline pressure increases
